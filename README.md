# Project-1

I have embedded these video files in my .ipynb notebooks, but they don't show up here. They are also available for download in my repository, along with all graphs created.

Links to all videos created in the scripts are posted below:

2. https://youtu.be/B0vGcWIrgpM - Air Temp Worldwide
3. https://youtu.be/bDtjPfTFjSQ - Air Temp North America
